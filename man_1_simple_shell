.P.BOverview.B
The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal,
 interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the program that can be 
launched from within the terminal with ./simple_shell within the simple shell folder.
If no arguments are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal,
the shell is considered an interactive shell. An interactive shell generally prompts before 
each command and handles programming and command errors differently.
